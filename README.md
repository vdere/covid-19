Analyze COVID-19 Virus Spread with Python

We will be using flask and folium python packages for making interactive dashboards.

The dataset consists of corona spread data from different countries and different cities. This dataset also contains the latitude and longitude of corona affected areas. We will filter and visualize the countries and the cites within countries with maximum corona cases.

Try with three datasets provided. Change the dataset name in the app.py file

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
open the dashboard at localhost:5050
